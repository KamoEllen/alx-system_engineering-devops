Schema illustrating the flow of the request created when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter.

The diagram should show:

DNS resolution
that the request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
that the traffic is encrypted
that the traffic goes through a firewall
that the request is distributed via a load balancer
that the web server answers the request by serving a web page
that the application server generates the web page
that the application server request data from the database

Explanation:
The browser makes a DNS query to resolve "google.com" to an IP address.
The DNS resolver sends the query to a DNS server, which responds with the IP address of Google's server.
The browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address on the appropriate port (typically port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS).
The request passes through a firewall for security.
The request is then distributed to a server in Google's server farm via a load balancer to ensure even distribution of traffic.
The web server receives the request and serves a web page.
The web server may request data from an application server.
The application server generates the web page content, which may involve querying a database for data.
The application server sends the generated web page back to the web server.
The web server sends the web page back to the browser.
The browser renders the web page for the user to see.
